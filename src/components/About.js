            <p>
            All things JavaScript/Typescript/Solidity, Express/Graphql, React/Apollo for some time now. Comfortable using Ethers.js, Web3.js and Alchemy Web3.  Can create, migrate, secure and also deploy smart contracts to a test blockchain like ganache, ropsten and kovan.
    Never going back to REST after using GraphQL. Lead Solidity dev on a defi project. Currently spend my free time researching blockchain technology. Interested in security hacker things and Urban City Education. I read source code for fun, enjoy spending time with my kids, and hope to one day build a Dapp targeting  Trivia gaming and  Children Education.
